# YAPP, i.e. Yet Another Pointing Poker

Fun times with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Cuba](https://github.com/soveran/cuba)

Accessible here: https://pointing-poke-it.herokuapp.com

Should only have to edit `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`

### To Run
`bundle` and then `bundle exec rackup`

This is fairly overkill, but I wanted to check out Cuba and Semantic UI; however, everything the site needs is contained within the three main files, `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`, so if you wanted to make even simpler with Heroku, check out [How to Deploy a Static Site to Heroku](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku)
